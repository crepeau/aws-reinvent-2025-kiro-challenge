# Documentation-First Approach

## Always Check Documentation

When working with AWS services, libraries, or frameworks:

1. **Search documentation first** before providing answers based on general knowledge
2. Use available MCP tools to search AWS documentation for:
   - Service features and capabilities
   - API references and SDK usage
   - Best practices and architecture patterns
   - CDK constructs and examples
   - Troubleshooting guides

3. **Prioritize official sources:**
   - AWS documentation via MCP tools
   - Library-specific documentation via Context7
   - Project README files and docs folders

4. **When to search:**
   - User asks about AWS services or features
   - Working with CDK or CloudFormation
   - Troubleshooting AWS-related errors
   - Implementing AWS integrations
   - Questions about API usage or configuration
